# Redi's Discord Bot Repository

Hello! Welcome to my DBM Repository,

I assume you're here for that raw data yas? Well of course!

This repository contains and stores all Raw Data packages created by Redi Panda_#3657.

All RD Packages are available and free for users to edit, **HOWEVER;**

*If you plan to redistribute and/or publish these RD, you must acquire permission from me and credit/link back to this repository. I hate it when people "create" content
then claim it as "their" work.*
