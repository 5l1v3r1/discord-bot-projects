# Redi's Raw Data Repo // Developing

Welcome to a sub page of the repository. This page is all about `Developing` status.


# What is Developing?

Developing is the stage of when the package is being built and constructed through DBM.

## How does it get developed?

The RD will get built in the main DBM application, and if necessary along with other API's, modules etc.

Usually all RD that get accepted will be developed first and layed out to see the structural pathflow of the commands.

If the package is under development, please be patience as I will be working on it depending on the `Master Status`.
