# Redi's Raw Data Repo // Not Maintained

Welcome to a sub page of the repository. This page is all about `Not Maintained` status.


# What does it mean by `Not Maintained`?

This package may be old and be dropped from the current active listing. Depending on the demand and issues, some packages will be dropped and will be stated: `Not Maintained`
This usually means that I won't be supporting (depends on how I'm feeling) for that particular RD nor posting any issue updates regards to it.

## Why is it `Not Maintained`?

Packages that are `Not Maintained` is due to time management. Some packages which are quick to make and won't bump into issues easily will drop into the `Not Maintained` listing.

I have other projects which may acquire more attention than others, which is why I've implemented this status.
